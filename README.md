# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Joram Bosire**

Time spent: **17** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/seemly-sprout-pint?path=script.js%3A1%3A0)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [x] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Considering it’s a memory game, it would be interesting to implement an algorithm that keeps track of a player’s stats over time and give a rough verdict on their memory ability and whether it’s improving over time as you play the game.
I would also add different game modes (for example easy and hard) to enable users test themselves. For example, have the music mix up for the buttons while the light stays the same or have the lights mix up while music stays the same so that people who primarily depend on either the tone or the lights are forced to approach the game differently. And I could also vary playback and guess speeds. Additionally, I would add special game modes so the game doesn’t become monotonous, such as a “reverse light-and-sound” where the pattern involves all but one button lighting up and sounding, or buttons switch positions on the screen during each sequence.
I would also work on making it more user-friendly by making it customizable. Users would be able to create their own patterns, increase or decrease the number of buttons and change button appearance and sound.
